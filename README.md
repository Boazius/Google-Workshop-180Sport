# A Project for the TAU Google workshop course.
# A Web app by Boaz, Gal, Dana, and Danielle for 180Sport: to schedule and manage an Attendence sheet of trainers, trainees, and volunteers

This web app has four different kinds of users:

Trainees:
  -will know who their trainers are in each group they are in
  -will know when and where is the next training session
  -will be able to mark their planned attendance: are they coming to the next training session or not.
  
Volunteers:
  -will be able to do the same things trainees do,
  -will also be able to see all trainees and volunteers in their groups.

Trainers:
  -will be able to do the same things volunteers do,
  -will also be able to mark attendance once the session starts
  -will be able to add notes about each trainee in their groups.
  -will be able to edit group session informaton: time and place, as well as any misc notes about it.
  
 Admins:
  -will be able to see every group and every user in it
  -will be able to add, edit, and remove users, and change their user type.
  -will be able to create new groups and delete/edit existing ones.
  
  
every user must login using google login/ email+password when entering the app, and then will be redirected to the corresponding page for them.
